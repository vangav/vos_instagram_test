# Response Error properties

# In case of a 400 BAD_REQUEST or a 500 INTERNAL_ERROR an error JSON response
#   with a fixed structure is returned containing the following elements:
#   - error_type
#   - error_code
#   - error_sub_code
#   - error_message
#   - error_class
#   - error_stack_trace
#   - error_trace_id
#
# This properties file controls which elements should be part of an error
#   response.
# For example one can only include error_code and sub_code for a client app
#   while including everything including stack_trace for an internal debugging
#   tool

# error_type
# Default: true
error_type=true

# error_code
# Default: true
error_code=true

# error_sub_code
# Default: true
error_sub_code=true

# error_message
# Default: true
error_message=true

# error_class
# Default: true
error_class=true

# error_stack_trace
# Default: true
error_stack_trace=true

# error_trace_id
