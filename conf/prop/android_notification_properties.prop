# Android notification properties
# In the common case of a backend for one application, this properties file
#   is a handy way to skip instantiating an AndroidNotificationSender and use
#   the singleton instance instead which uses values from this properties
#   file
# Set to use the singleton method for AndroidNotificationSender instead of
#   having to create an instance and hard code these properties
