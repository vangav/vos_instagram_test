# Param Validator properties

# In addition to checking a param's type/format (e.g.: int, float, base64,
#   e-mail, phone number, etc ...) some params have other validation
#   requirements that vary from one backend service to another
#   (e.g.: text length, photo size, etc ...)
# This properties file is used to define such validation values

# Photo Size is used to define the maximum photo's size (int Bytes)
# Default: 5000000 (five million)
photo_size=5000000

# Caption Length is used define the maximum length for a photo's caption text
# Default: 100
caption_length=100

# Chat Message Lentgh is used to define the maximum length for a chat's message
# Default: 10000 (ten thousand)
